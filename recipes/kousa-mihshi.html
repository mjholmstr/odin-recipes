        <h3 class="description">Zucchini Stuffed with Spiced Meat and Rice, Served with Tomato Sauce and Yogurt</h3>
        <p class="description-text">I find this to be a delicious way to utilize
            medium to large zucchini.  Use an apple corer and/or melon-baller to 
            hollow out zucchini.  Can substitute beef for the lamb and extra meat/rice Served
            with the sauce and yogurt is great as well.  You will have the zucchini
            "innards" left over that can be used for something else.
            This recipe is by Dominique Khoury
            in the July & August 2022 issue of Cook's Illustrated magazine.

        <h3 class="steps-heading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>FOR THE HASHWEH: Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse
                under cold running water until water runs clear. Place rice 
                in bowl and cover with 2 cups hot water; let stand for 10 minutes.
                Drain rice in now-empty strainer and return to bowl. Add lamb, 1 
                tablespoon oil, salt, pepper. and cinnamon and mix until rice is well
                dispersed. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet
                over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add lamb mixture to skillet and
                mash to thin layer. Cook, stirring constantly and breaking up meat with
                spatula until meat is almost cooked through but still slightly pink, 3
                to 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to now-empty strainer set over bowl.
                Return juices and fat to skillet. Transfer lamb mixture to now-empty bowl
                and, using fork, break up mixture until meat is reduced to pieces no larger
                than 1/4 inch.
            </li>
            <li>FOR THE SAUVE: Add oil to juices and fat in skillet and heat over med-low 
                heat until sizzling. Stir in pepper and cinnamon and cook until just fragrant
                , about 30 seconds. Add onion and garlis and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until very soft and light golden, 7 to 9 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer onion mixture to food processor. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 
                vinegar, and salt to processor and process until smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
                Transfer tomato mixture to now-empty skillet. Bring to boil over medium-high
                heat. Reduce heat to simmer and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally,
                until sauce is thickened and spatula dragged across bottom of skillet 
                leaves a trail, 25 to 30 minutes. While sauce cooks, prepare zucchini.
            </li>
            <li>FOR THE ZUCCHINI: Remove stem end of 1 zucchini and discard. Holding
                zucchini with your hand, insert apple corer into stemmed end and press
                and turn until cutting end of corer is about 1/2 inch from bottom of 
                zucchini, being careful not to damage walls of zucchini. Using melon melon-baller
                or long-handled spoon, scoop out any remaining core in pieces. Repeat
                with remaining zucchini.
            </li>
            <li>Hold 1 zucchini stemmed side up on counter. Using your hand or small
                spoon, drop small portions of stuffing into hollow, tapping bottom
                of zucchini on counter to help stuffing settle.  Repeat with remaining
                zucchini and stuffing.
            </li>
            <li>Remove sauce from heat. Gently arrange stuffed zucchini in single layer
                in skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat and bring to boil.
                Adjust heat to maintainlow simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minute. Turn 
                zucchini over gently. Cover and continue to simmer until rice and meat
                are fully cooked and zucchini are tender but not mushy, 20 to 25 minutes
                longer. Drizzle zucchini and sauce with oil; sprinkle with parsley; and 
                serve, passing yogurt separately.
