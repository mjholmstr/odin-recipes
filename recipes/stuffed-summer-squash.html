        <h3 class="steps-heading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange oven rack 6 inches from heat source and preheat
                broiler. Grease a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Cut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds and enough 
                pulp to leave 1/2 inch thick shell. Brush halves with 1 Tbsp.
                oil and arrange, cut sides down, on prepared baking sheet. 
                Broil squash until hot and beginning to release beads of 
                moisture, about 5 minutes. Remove squash from oven and adjust
                heat to 450F.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in large skillet over medium-low heat. Add chopped
                garlic and shallot. Cook, stirring frequently, until shallot is 
                translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Toss together remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, shrimp, tomato, mushrooms,
                1/4 cup Parmesan, basil, cooked garlic and shallot, salt, pepper, and 
                garlic powder in a bowl. Spoon shrimp mixture into squash halves and 
                sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
            </li>
            <li>Bake stuffed squash until cheese is browned, filling is hot, and 
                shrimp are opaque, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
